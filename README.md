# Echo Server Lab (Multi-protocol)

This project demonstrates how client-server communication works across **four major network protocols**

- **TCP**
- **UDP**
- **WebSocket**
- **Socket.IO**

Each folder contains:

- Server Implementation
- Client Implementation
- Test commands

---

## Goal

Understand **how data flows beteen client and server** using different network transports and how each behaves:

| Protocol  | Level | Type                    | Best For                           |
| --------- | ----- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| TCP       | Low   | Connection-oriented     | Reliable data transfer (HTTP, SSH) |
| UDP       | Low   | Connectionless          | Fast, real-time, streaming, games  |
| WebSocket | Mid   | Persistent full-duplex  | Modern real-time apps              |
| Socket.IO | High  | Framework on WebSockets | Reconnects, rooms, fallbacks       |
